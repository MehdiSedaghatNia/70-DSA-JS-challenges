# Traversy JS Challenges, Data Structures, and Algorithms

This is from the `70 JavaScript challenges, data structures, and algorithms` course by `Brad Traversy`.

This course goes over everything from basic loop challenges, recursion, complexity, data structures, and algorithms. All challenges are solved by myself.

## File Structure

Each folder includes:

- `readme.md` - The challenge/code instructions. 
- `[name].js` - This is your working file. It has the Solution that I come up with.(It may contain more than one solution as well as adding extra features to that challenge by myself).

## And at the end... Challenge Upgrade(by myself): and solving it by various methods from low level to high level
